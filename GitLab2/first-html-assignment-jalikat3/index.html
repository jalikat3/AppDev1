        <h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
        <h2>By Jali Purcell</h2>
        <p>
            My full name is Jali Katherine Purcell. My name is a combination of my dad's name, 
            Jason, and my mom's name, Lisa. Katherine is a family name. I was born in Springfield, Missouri,
            and I live in Republic, Missouri. I go to school at Drury University, majoring
            in Computer Science: Software Engineering and Spanish, with a minor in Cyber Risk Management.

            Besides taking classes, you can see me on campus playing the bass drum
            in the Drury Panthers Marching Band, or filming videos as a DUTV
            staff member. I also enjoy reading, writing, and watching movies with friends.
            My core values are learning and adaptability. I feel most in my element
            when I am learning something new, or advancing my skills with something
            I already know. I am not afraid of big life changes, and look forward to
            whatever new changes come my way every day.

            I chose this picture because it shows that I like to travel.
            This picture was taken in the Grand Canyon this summer. I am
            very lucky in that our family is in a position to take frequent
            family trips every year. We have taken family trips to Colarado, 
            Wicsonsin, California, Florida, and this last one, Arizona to Utah,
            ending in Las Vegas, Nevada. I have been out of the United States
            to Mexico and Canada, on the way to Alaska on a cruise. I hope to continue my love for travel 
            in my adult life, starting with studying abroad in Spain in Summer 2022.

# MyTravels
Using the discussion from class on links, the text of the web page, and information from your textbook on links, update the code to include a section on a favorite place you have traveled.  Your modification should:
*  Add a new folder in the Destinations folder for your destination.
*  Add one html page representing the spot you chose for your travel. (ie, Follow my example of using a place for which you have a photo. (Hint: Copy one of my pages and rename it.)
*  Add folder to the images folder for images from your destination.
*  Add a minimum of four images from your destination to the folder you created in images.
*  Choose one of these images as the focus of your page and edit the page you copied to represent your new destination page.
*  Edit the home page (index.html) so that your new destination is displayed and so there is a working link to the new page.
*  Change the copyright in the footer to 2021 and add your name in addition to mine.
